# 🩺 Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project builds a **Machine Learning model** to classify breast tumors as **Benign (B)** or **Malignant (M)** based on features extracted from fine needle aspirate (FNA) images.

## 📌 Dataset
The dataset used is **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set**, available on Kaggle:  
[🔗 Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **pandas** → Data handling & preprocessing
- **numpy** → Numerical computations
- **matplotlib & seaborn** → Data visualization
- **scikit-learn** → Machine Learning Model
